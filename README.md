# PPT-Align-Dialog
This is an AppleScript-Pashua-based dialog box to align shapes in PowerPoint 2016. I've always been frustrated that since Microsoft went with the Ribbon UI, you could no longer have a floating Align palette to quickly align shapes. This script is designed to somewhat remediate that by displaying a quick pop-up dialog to align selected shapes. Admittedly it's not quite the same, but it's faster than going through the Ribbon to access alignment commands. 

## Requirements
You will need to install [Pashua](https://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/ "Link to Pashua) in a standard location for this script to work. However, all of the code required to run the script is in the file.

This will also require PowerPoint 2016. This may work on earlier versions of PowerPoint for Mac, but as I understand it, older versions may not have the "Align" AppleScript command.

## Installation
I use this script with [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/index.html "Link to FastScripts"), which makes it easier to launch via a shortcut from within PowerPoint 2016. This is especially true now that PowerPoint no longer has a dedicated Scripts menu.

In FastScripts, create a application-specific folder, then move this script file into that directory. You can add a keyboard shortcut from the FastScripts Preferences dialog box.
